    "In the introduction we learned about the loss function: it quantifies the total error of the predictions made by the model.\n",
    "During model training we aim to find the model parameters that minimize the loss.\n",
    "This is called optimization, but how does optimization actually work?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gradient descent\n",
    "Gradient descent is a widely used optimization algorithm, most other optimization algorithms are based on it.\n",
    "It works as follows: Imagine a neural network with only one neuron.\n",
    "Take a look at the figure below. The plot shows the loss as a function of the weight of the neuron.\n",
    "As you can see there is a global loss minimum, we would like to find the weight at this point in the parabola.\n",
    "To do this, we initialize the model weight with some random value. Then we compute the gradient of the loss function with respect\n",
    "to the weight. This tells us how much the loss function will change if we change the weight by a small amount.\n",
    "Then, we update the weight by taking a small step in the direction of the negative gradient, so down the slope.\n",
    "This will slightly decrease the loss. This process is repeated until the loss function reaches a minimum.\n",
    "The size of the step that is taken in each iteration is called the 'learning rate'.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://github.com/carpentries-lab/deep-learning-intro/raw/main/episodes/fig/03_gradient_descent.png){alt='Plot of the loss as a function of the weights. Through gradient descent the global loss minimum is found'}\n",
    "\n",
    "### Batch gradient descent\n",
    "You could use the entire training dataset to perform one learning step in gradient descent,\n",
    "which would mean that one epoch equals one learning step.\n",
    "In practice, in each learning step we only use a subset of the training data to compute the loss and the gradients.\n",
    "This subset is called a 'batch', the number of samples in one batch is called the 'batch size'.\n",

    "## Challenge: Exercise: Gradient descent\n",

    "Answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. What is the goal of optimization?\n",
    "\n",
    "- A. To find the weights that maximize the loss function\n",
    "- B. To find the weights that minimize the loss function\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. What happens in one gradient descent step?\n",
    "\n",
    "- A. The weights are adjusted so that we move in the direction of the gradient, so up the slope of the loss function\n",
    "- B. The weights are adjusted so that we move in the direction of the gradient, so down the slope of the loss function\n",
    "- C. The weights are adjusted so that we move in the direction of the negative gradient, so up the slope of the loss function\n",
    "- D. The weights are adjusted so that we move in the direction of the negative gradient, so down the slope of the loss function\n",

    "### 3. When the batch size is increased:\n",
    "(multiple answers might apply)\n",
    "\n",
    "- A. The number of samples in an epoch also increases\n",
    "- B. The number of batches in an epoch goes down\n",
    "- C. The training progress is more jumpy, because more samples are consulted in each update step (one batch).\n",
    "- D. The memory load (memory as in computer hardware) of the training process is increased:::\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Choose a loss function and optimizer\n",
    "### Loss function\n",
    "The loss is what the neural network will be optimized on during training, so choosing a suitable loss function is crucial for training neural networks.\n",
    "In the given case we want to stimulate that the predicted values are as close as possible to the true values. This is commonly done by using the *mean squared error* (mse) or the *mean absolute error* (mae), both of which should work OK in this case. Often, mse is preferred over mae because it \"punishes\" large prediction errors more severely.\n",
    "In Keras this is implemented in the `keras.losses.MeanSquaredError` class (see Keras documentation: https://keras.io/api/losses/). This can be provided into the `model.compile` method with the `loss` parameter and setting it to `mse`, e.g.\n",
