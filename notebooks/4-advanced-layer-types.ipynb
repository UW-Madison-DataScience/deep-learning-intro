    "\n",
    "So far, we have seen one type of layer, namely the **fully connected**, or **dense** layer. This layer is called fully connected, because all input neurons are taken into account by each output neuron. The number of parameters that need to be learned by the network, is thus in the order of magnitude of the number of input neurons times the number of hidden neurons.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are many different types of layers that perform different calculations and take different inputs. In this episode we will take a look at **convolutional layers** and **dropout layers**, which are useful in the context of image data, but also in many other types of (structured) data.\n",

    "Dropout means that during each training cycle (one forward pass of the data through the model) a random fraction of neurons in a dense layer are turned off.\n",

    "The intuition behind dropout is that it enforces redundancies in the network by constantly removing different elements of a network. The model can no longer rely on individual nodes and instead must create multiple \"paths\". In addition, the model has to make predictions with much fewer nodes and weights (connections between the nodes).\n",
    "As a result, it becomes much harder for a network to memorize particular features. At first this might appear a quite drastic approach which affects the network architecture strongly.\n",
    "In practice, however, dropout is computationally a very elegant solution which does not affect training speed. And it frequently works very well.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important to note:** Dropout layers will only randomly silence nodes during training! During a prediction step, all nodes remain active (dropout is off). During training, the sample of nodes that are silenced are different for each training instance, to give all nodes a chance to observe enough training data to learn its weights.\n",

    "The goal is to show that hyperparameter tuning can be done easily with `keras_tuner`, not to memorize all the exact syntax of how to do it. This will probably save you half an hour of participants typing over code that they already know from before. In addition, on really slow machines running the grid search could possibly take more than 10 minutes.\n",

    "Recall that hyperparameters are model configuration settings that are chosen before the training process and affect the model's learning behavior and performance, for example the dropout rate. In general, if you are varying hyperparameters to find the combination of hyperparameters with the best model performance this is called hyperparameter tuning. A naive way to do this is to write a for-loop and train a slightly different model in every cycle.\n",
