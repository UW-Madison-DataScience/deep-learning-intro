    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this episode we will learn how to create and train a neural network using Keras to solve a simple classification task.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this episode is to quickly get your hands dirty in actually defining and training a neural network,\n",
    "without going into depth of how neural networks work on a technical or mathematical level.\n",
    "We want you to go through the full deep learning workflow once before going into more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, this is also what we would recommend you to do when working on real-world problems:\n",
    "First quickly build a working pipeline, while taking shortcuts.\n",
    "Then, slowly make the pipeline more advanced while you keep on evaluating the approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "In [episode 3](episodes/3-monitor-the-model.md) we will expand on the concepts that are lightly introduced in this episode.\n",
    "Some of these concepts include: how to monitor the training progress and how optimization works.\n",
    "\n",
    "::: instructor\n",
    "It is good to stress the goal for this episode a few times, because learners will usually have a lot of questions like:\n",
    "'Why don't we normalize our features' or 'Why do we choose Adam optimizer?'.\n",
    "It can be a good idea to park some of these questions for discussion in episode 3 and 4.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "As a reminder below are the steps of the deep learning workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Formulate / Outline the problem\n",
    "2. Identify inputs and outputs\n",
    "3. Prepare data\n",
    "4. Choose a pretrained model or start building architecture from scratch\n",
    "5. Choose a loss function and optimizer\n",
    "6. Train the model\n",
    "7. Perform a Prediction/Classification\n",
    "8. Measure performance\n",
    "9. Refine the model\n",
    "10. Save model\n",
    "\n",
    "In this episode we will focus on a minimal example for each of these steps, later episodes will build on this knowledge to go into greater depth for some or all of these steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Callout: GPU usage\n",
    "\n",
    "For this lesson having a [GPU (graphics processing unit)](https://glosario.carpentries.org/en/#gpu) available is not needed.\n",
    "We specifically use very small toy problems so that you do not need one.\n",
    "However, Keras will use your GPU automatically when it is available.\n",
    "Using a GPU becomes necessary when tackling larger datasets or complex problems which\n",
    "require a more complex neural network.:::\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Formulate/outline the problem: penguin classification\n",
    "In this episode we will be using the [penguin dataset](https://zenodo.org/record/3960218). This is a dataset that was published in 2020 by Allison Horst and contains data on three different species of the penguins.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the penguin dataset to train a neural network which can classify which species a\n",
    "penguin belongs to, based on their physical characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Callout: Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to predict a penguins' species using the attributes available in this dataset.:::\n",
    "\n",
    "The `palmerpenguins` data contains size measurements for three penguin species observed on three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica.\n",
    "The physical attributes measured are flipper length, beak length, beak width, body mass, and sex.\n",

    "\n",
    "## 2. Identify inputs and outputs\n",
    "To identify the inputs and outputs that we will use to design the neural network we need to familiarize\n",
    "ourselves with the dataset. This step is sometimes also called data exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start by importing the [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) library that will help us get the dataset and visualize it.\n",
    "Seaborn is a powerful library with many visualizations. Keep in mind it requires the data to be in a\n",
