    "Deep learning (DL) is just one of many techniques collectively known as machine learning. Machine learning (ML) refers to techniques where a computer can \"learn\" patterns in data, usually by being shown numerous examples to train it. People often talk about machine learning being a form of artificial intelligence (AI). Definitions of artificial intelligence vary, but usually involve having computers mimic the behaviour of intelligent biological systems. Since the 1950s many works of science fiction have dealt with the idea of an artificial intelligence which matches (or exceeds) human intelligence in all areas. Although there have been great advances in AI and ML research recently we can only come close to human like intelligence in a few specialist areas and are still a long way from a general purpose AI.\n",

    "A neural network is an artificial intelligence technique loosely based on the way neurons in the brain work.\n",
    "A neural network consists of connected computational units called **neurons**.\n",
    "Let's look at the operations of a single neuron.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### A single neuron\n",
    " Each neuron ...\n",
    "\n",
    "- has one or more inputs ($x_1, x_2, ...$), e.g. input data expressed as floating point numbers\n",
    "- most of the time, each neuron conducts 3 main operations:\n",
    "  + take the weighted sum of the inputs where ($w_1, w_2, ...$) indicate weights\n",
    "  + add an extra constant weight (i.e. a bias term) to this weighted sum\n",
    "  + apply an **activation function** to the output so far, we will explain activation functions\n",
    "- return one output value, again a floating point number.\n",
    "- one example equation to calculate the output for a neuron is: $output = Activation(\\sum_{i} (x_i*w_i) + bias)$\n",

    "$$ f(x) = \\max(0, x) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This involves a simple comparison and maximum calculation, which are basic operations that are computationally inexpensive.\n",
    "It is also simple to compute the gradient: 1 for positive inputs and 0 for negative inputs.\n",

    "3. This function is the most popular activation function in hidden layers, since it introduces non-linearity in a computationally efficient way.\n",
    "4. This function is useful in classification tasks when applied to an output neuron\n",

    "Multiple neurons can be joined together by connecting the output of one to the input of another. These connections are associated with weights that determine the 'strength' of the connection, the weights are adjusted during training. In this way, the combination of neurons and connections describe a computational graph, an example can be seen in the image below.\n",
