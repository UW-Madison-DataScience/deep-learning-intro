<p>Deep Learning (DL) is just one of many techniques collectively known
as machine learning. Machine learning (ML) refers to techniques where a
computer can âlearnâ patterns in data, usually by being shown numerous
examples to train it. People often talk about machine learning being a
form of artificial intelligence (AI). Definitions of artificial
intelligence vary, but usually involve having computers mimic the
behaviour of intelligent biological systems. Since the 1950s many works
of science fiction have dealt with the idea of an artificial
intelligence which matches (or exceeds) human intelligence in all areas.
Although there have been great advances in AI and ML research recently
we can only come close to human like intelligence in a few specialist
areas and are still a long way from a general purpose AI. The image
below shows some differences between artificial intelligence, Machine
Learning and Deep Learning.</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/01_AI_ML_DL_differences.png" alt="An infographics showing the relation of AI, ML, NN and DL.

<h4 id="neural-networks">Neural Networks<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#neural-networks"></a></h4>
<p>A neural network is an artificial intelligence technique loosely
based on the way neurons in the brain work.</p>
<div class="section level5">
<h5 id="a-single-neuron">A single neuron<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#a-single-neuron"></a></h5>
<p>A neural network consists of connected computational units called
<strong>neurons</strong>. Each neuron â¦</p>
<ul><li>has one or more inputs, e.g.Â input data expressed as floating point
numbers</li>
<li>most of the time, each neuron conducts 3 main operations:
<ul><li>take the weighted sum of the inputs</li>
<li>add an extra constant weight (i.e.Â a bias term) to this weighted
sum</li>
<li>apply a non-linear function to the output so far (using a predefined
activation function)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>return one output value, again a floating point number</li>
</ul><figure><img src="../fig/01_neuron.png" alt="A diagram of a single artificial neuron combining inputs and weights using an activation function." width="600" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure></div>
<div class="section level5">
<h5 id="combinging-multiple-neurons-into-a-network">Combinging multiple neurons into a network<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#combinging-multiple-neurons-into-a-network"></a></h5>
<p>Multiple neurons can be joined together by connecting the output of
one to the input of another. These connections are associated with
weights that determine the âstrengthâ of the connection, the weights are
adjusted during training. In this way, the combination of neurons and
connections describe a computational graph, an example can be seen in
the image below. In most neural networks neurons are aggregated into
layers. Signals travel from the input layer to the output layer,
possibly through one or more intermediate layers called hidden layers.
The image below shows an example of a neural network with three layers,
each circle is a neuron, each line is an edge and the arrows indicate
the direction data moves in.</p>

<p>Neural networks arenât a new technique, they have been around since
the late 1940s. But until around 2010 neural networks tended to be quite
small, consisting of only 10s or perhaps 100s of neurons. This limited
them to only solving quite basic problems. Around 2010 improvements in
computing power and the algorithms for training the networks made much
larger and more powerful networks practical. These are known as deep
neural networks or Deep Learning.</p>
<p>Deep Learning requires extensive training using example data which
shows the network what output it should produce for a given input. One
common application of Deep Learning is classifying images. Here the
network will be trained by being âshownâ a series of images and told
what they contain. Once the network is trained it should be able to take
another image and correctly classify its contents. But we are not
restricted to just using images, any kind of data can be learned by a
Deep Learning neural network. This makes them able to appear to learn a
set of complex rules only by being shown what the inputs and outputs of
those rules are instead of being taught the actual rules. Using these
approaches Deep Learning networks have been taught to play video games
and even drive cars. The data on which networks are trained usually has
to be quite extensive, typically including thousands of examples. For
this reason they are not suited to all applications and should be
considered just one of many machine learning techniques which are
available.</p>
<p>While traditional âshallowâ networks might have had between three and
five layers, deep networks often have tens or even hundreds of layers.
This leads to them having millions of individual weights. The image
below shows a diagram of all the layers (there are too many neurons to
draw them all) on a Deep Learning network designed to detect pedestrians
in images. The input (left most) layer of the network is an image and
the final (right most) layer of the network outputs a zero or one to
determine if the input data belongs to the class of data we are
interested in. This image is from the paper <a href="https://doi.org/10.1155/2018/3518959" class="external-link">âAn Efficient Pedestrian
Detection Method Based on YOLOv2â by Zhongmin Liu, Zhicai Chen, Zhanming

</h2>
<hr class="half-width"><p>The rise of Deep Learning is partially due to the increased
availability of very large datasets. But how much data do you actually
need to train a Deep Learning model? Unfortunately, this question is not
easy to answer. It depends, among other things, on the complexity of the
task (which you often do not know beforehand), the quality of the
available dataset and the complexity of the network. For complex tasks
with large neural networks, we often see that adding more data continues
to improve performance. However, this is also not a generic truth: if
the data you add is too similar to the data you already have, it will
not give much new information to the neural network.</p>

</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>In case you have too little data available to train a complex network
from scratch, it is sometimes possible to use a pretrained network that
was trained on a similar problem. Another trick is data augmentation,
where you expand the dataset with artificial data points that could be
real. An example of this is mirroring images when trying to classify
cats and dogs. An horizontally mirrored animal retains the label, but
exposes a different view.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width"><p>To apply Deep Learning to a problem there are several steps we need
to go through:</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="formulate-outline-the-problem">1. Formulate/ Outline the problem<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#formulate-outline-the-problem"></a></h3>
<p>Firstly we must decide what it is we want our Deep Learning system to
do. Is it going to classify some data into one of a few categories? For
example if we have an image of some hand written characters, the neural
network could classify which character it is being shown. Or is it going
to perform a prediction? For example trying to predict what the price of
something will be tomorrow given some historical data on pricing and
current trends.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="identify-inputs-and-outputs">2. Identify inputs and outputs<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#identify-inputs-and-outputs"></a></h3>
<p>Next we need to identify what the inputs and outputs of the neural
network will be. This might require looking at our data and deciding
what features of the data we can use as inputs. If the data is images
then the inputs could be the individual pixels of the images.</p>
<p>For the outputs we will need to look at what we want to identify from
the data. If we are performing a classification problem then typically
we will have one output for each potential class.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="prepare-data">3. Prepare data<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#prepare-data"></a></h3>
<p>Many datasets are not ready for immediate use in a neural network and
will require some preparation. Neural networks can only really deal with
numerical data, so any non-numerical data (for example words) will have
to be somehow converted to numerical data.</p>
<p>Next we will need to divide the data into multiple sets. One of these
will be used by the training process and we will call it the training
set. Another will be used to evaluate the accuracy of the training and
we will call that one the test set. Sometimes we will also use a 3rd set
known as a validation set to tune hyperparameters.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="choose-a-pre-trained-model-or-build-a-new-architecture-from-scratch">4. Choose a pre-trained model or build a new architecture from
scratch<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#choose-a-pre-trained-model-or-build-a-new-architecture-from-scratch"></a></h3>
<p>Often we can use an existing neural network instead of designing one
from scratch. Training a network can take a lot of time and
computational resources. There are a number of well publicised networks
which have been shown to perform well at certain tasks, if you know of
one which already does a similar task well then it makes sense to use
one of these.</p>
<p>If instead we decide we do want to design our own network then we
need to think about how many input neurons it will have, how many hidden
layers and how many outputs, what types of layers we use (we will
explore the different types later on). This will probably need some
experimentation and we might have to try tweaking the network design a
few times before we see acceptable results.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="choose-a-loss-function-and-optimizer">5. Choose a loss function and optimizer<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#choose-a-loss-function-and-optimizer"></a></h3>
<p>The loss function tells the training algorithm how far away the
predicted value was from the true value. We will look at choosing a loss
function in more detail later on.</p>
<p>The optimizer is responsible for taking the output of the loss
function and then applying some changes to the weights within the
network. It is through this process that the âlearningâ (adjustment of
the weights) is achieved.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="train-the-model">6. Train the model<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#train-the-model"></a></h3>
<p>We can now go ahead and start training our neural network. We will
probably keep doing this for a given number of iterations through our
training dataset (referred to as <em>epochs</em>) or until the loss
function gives a value under a certain threshold. The graph below show
the loss against the number of <em>epochs</em>, generally the loss will
go down with each <em>epoch</em>, but occasionally it will see a small
rise.</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/training-0_to_1500.svg" alt="A graph showing an exponentially decreasing loss over the first 1500 epochs of training an example network." class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure></div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="perform-a-predictionclassification">7. Perform a Prediction/Classification<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#perform-a-predictionclassification"></a></h3>
<p>After training the network we can use it to perform predictions. This
is the mode you would use the network in after you have fully trained it
to a satisfactory performance. Doing predictions on a special hold-out
set is used in the next step to measure the performance of the
network.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="measure-performance">8. Measure Performance<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#measure-performance"></a></h3>
<p>Once we trained the network we want to measure its performance. To do
this we use some additional data that was not part of the training, this
is known as a test set. There are many different methods available for
measuring performance and which one is best depends on the type of task
we are attempting. These metrics are often published as an indication of
how well our network performs.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="tune-hyperparameters">9. Tune Hyperparameters<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#tune-hyperparameters"></a></h3>
<p>Hyperparameters are all the parameters set by the person configuring
the machine learning instead of those learned by the algorithm itself.
The hyperparameters include the number of epochs or the parameters for
the optimizer. It might be necessary to adjust these and re-run the
training many times before we are happy with the result.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="share-model">10. Share Model<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#share-model"></a></h3>
<p>Now that we have a trained network that performs at a level we are
happy with we can go and use it on real data to perform a prediction. At
this point we might want to consider publishing a file with both the
architecture of our network and the weights which it has learned
(assuming we did not use a pre-trained network). This will allow others
to use it as as pre-trained network for their own purposes and for them
to (mostly) reproduce our result.</p>

<hr class="half-width"><p>There are many software libraries available for Deep Learning
including:</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="tensorflow">TensorFlow<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#tensorflow"></a></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/" class="external-link">TensorFlow</a> was developed by
Google and is one of the older Deep Learning libraries, ported across
many languages since it was first released to the public in 2015. It is
very versatile and capable of much more than Deep Learning but as a
result it often takes a lot more lines of code to write Deep Learning
operations in TensorFlow than in other libraries. It offers (almost)
seamless integration with GPU accelerators and Googleâs own TPU (Tensor
Processing Unit) chips that are built specially for machine
learning.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="pytorch">PyTorch<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#pytorch"></a></h3>
<p><a href="https://pytorch.org/" class="external-link">PyTorch</a> was developed by Facebook
in 2016 and is a popular choice for Deep Learning applications. It was
developed for Python from the start and feels a lot more âpythonicâ than
TensorFlow. Like TensorFlow it was designed to do more than just Deep
Learning and offers some very low level interfaces. <a href="https://www.pytorchlightning.ai/" class="external-link">PyTorch Lightning</a> offers a
higher level interface to PyTorch to set up experiments. Like TensorFlow
it is also very easy to integrate PyTorch with a GPU. In many benchmarks
it outperforms the other libraries.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="keras">Keras<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#keras"></a></h3>
<p><a href="https://keras.io/" class="external-link">Keras</a> is designed to be easy to use
and usually requires fewer lines of code than other libraries. We have
chosen it for this workshop for that reason. Keras can actually work on
top of TensorFlow (and several other libraries), hiding away the
complexities of TensorFlow while still allowing you to make use of their
features.</p>
<p>The performance of Keras is sometimes not as good as other libraries
and if you are going to move on to create very large networks using very
large datasets then you might want to consider one of the other
libraries. But for many applications the performance difference will not
be enough to worry about and the time you will save with simpler code
will exceed what you will save by having the code run a little
faster.</p>
<p>Keras also benefits from a very good set of <a href="https://keras.io/guides/" class="external-link">online documentation</a> and a large
user community. You will find that most of the concepts from Keras
translate very well across to the other libraries if you wish to learn
them at a later date.</p>

    2022-11-07: we have gotten a notification that we have an overage for our
    tracking and I'm pretty sure this has to do with Workbench usage.
    Considering that I am not _currently_ using this tracking because I do not
    yet know how to access the data, I am turning this off for now.
  <script>
    var _paq = window._paq = window._paq || [];
    /* tracker methods like "setCustomDimension" should be called before "trackPageView" */
    _paq.push(["setDocumentTitle", document.domain + "/" + document.title]);
    _paq.push(["setDomains", ["*.preview.carpentries.org","*.datacarpentry.github.io","*.datacarpentry.org","*.librarycarpentry.github.io","*.librarycarpentry.org","*.swcarpentry.github.io", "*.carpentries.github.io"]]);
    _paq.push(["setDoNotTrack", true]);
    _paq.push(["disableCookies"]);
    _paq.push(['trackPageView']);
    _paq.push(['enableLinkTracking']);
    (function() {
          var u="https://carpentries.matomo.cloud/";
          _paq.push(['setTrackerUrl', u+'matomo.php']);
          _paq.push(['setSiteId', '1']);
          var d=document, g=d.createElement('script'), s=d.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];
          g.async=true; g.src='https://cdn.matomo.cloud/carpentries.matomo.cloud/matomo.js'; s.parentNode.insertBefore(g,s);
        })();
  </script>
